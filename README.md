# Metacritic Crawl
##Summary
Using Kimino, crawl through metacritic's critic and user scores to find an average. 
##Purpose
I wanted to leverage Metacritic to analyze how we use ratings. It all started because I, like many people, think that average ratings tend more toward "7/10" rather than a true average "5/10". Using metacritic, I want to analyze this hypothsis. 
##Plan
- [x] intial kimono setup
- [x] grab all critic ratings from one movie
- [x] grab all user ratings from one movie

- [ ] grab individual movie scores from a large amount of movies
- [ ] grab metacritic user scores of a large amount of movies
- [ ] grab individual critic scores from a large amount of movies
- [ ] **TODO** LIST:
